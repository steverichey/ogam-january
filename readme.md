This is a C++ game using [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/). This is my January submission for [One Game A Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/).

# How to Play

It's not playable yet! Come back later.

# Notes

To get started with SDL I used [this great tutorial](http://www.willusher.io/pages/sdl2/) by Will Usher.  
This game uses the Ivory Waltz font by [CNI Angel](http://cniangel.net/), which you can get [here](https://github.com/steverichey/ivory-waltz-svg).
