This is a C++ game using [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/). This is my January submission for [One Game A Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/). It was coded on a Mac using Xcode. Art was done in Photoshop. The sound effect was made using the [BFXR app](http://www.bfxr.net/).

# How to Play

It's not playable yet! Come back later.

# Notes

To get started with SDL I used [this great tutorial](http://www.willusher.io/pages/sdl2/) by Will Usher. I also referenced the always great [Lazyfoo tutorials](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php), as we all must at some time or another.
