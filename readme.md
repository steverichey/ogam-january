This is a C++ game using [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/). This is my January submission for [One Game A Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/). It was coded on a Mac using Xcode. Art was done in Photoshop. The lone sound effect was made using the [BFXR app](http://www.bfxr.net/).

# How to Play

This game is available for Mac OS X only. You can [download it](https://github.com/steverichey/ogam-january/releases/download/Release/dont-crash-the-game.dmg) and then extract it and run it anywhere.

# Controls

Use up, down, left, and right to move. Press Escape to quit.

# Rules

Don't crash the game!

# Notes

To get started with SDL I used [this great tutorial](http://www.willusher.io/pages/sdl2/) by Will Usher. I also referenced the always great [Lazyfoo tutorials](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php), as we all must at some time or another.
